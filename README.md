# Gamma-Ray-Spectroscopy

The data and codes used to analyze the data for the gamma ray spectroscopy lab are stored here. We used a NaI scintalator to measure the light emiited from transitions in the daughter nuclei of beta emitters. The light was caputred and we were able to identify the element based on the specturm. We used several sources for calibration and identified an unknown sample based on the specturm measured.
